# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# 100.times do |i|
#     Note.create!(
#         user_id: rand(1..3),
#         image: open("#{Rails.root}/app/assets/images/jb2.jpg"),
#         title: "hello",
#         content: "#{i}回目のhello"
#     )
# end
